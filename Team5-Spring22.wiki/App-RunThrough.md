Here is a video walkthrough of our app functionality and layout! We have also broken down our app in key components below. [Video Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GAj7xAnauRyNEOWGDR4G9b3QmKZTFI_R/view?usp=sharing)

# Logging in 
## Account Creation & Email Verification

<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/SignUp.PNG" width="200" height="400" />

On the left is the login screen, in the center is the login screen displaying a login error, and on the right is the sign up screen. Users sign up with an email and password. Upon account creation, users are sent a verification link to the email they supplied at sign up that must be clicked before they are able to successfully login. The "Email not verified!" error along with several other login errors ("Wrong password", "No associated user account", and "Invalid email") are displayed to users when they occur. The "No associated user account" error is shown above (center) with the error circled for emphasis.

# DAHA 
## Feed

<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/daha-feed-before.PNG" width="200" height="400" />

After logging in, the user is taken to the DAHA feed. Here, all DAHA requests are displayed, with corresponding requester names and emails, desired buy/rent dates, and request completion statuses. Similar to other screens of the app, the user can scroll up to refresh and retrieve the latest updates.

## Making new post

<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/empty-new-request.PNG" width="150" height="300" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/new-request-buy.PNG" width="150" height="300" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/new-request-buy-rent.PNG" width="150" height="300" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/daha-feed-after.PNG" width="150" height="300" />

On the DAHA screen, users may click "Make a Request" to make their own DAHA request. Clicking the button brings up a new screen, where a user can fill out their request details, such as whether they wish to buy or rent their requested item, and their preferred buy/rent date(s). Afterwards, the user can click "Post" and see their request added to the DAHA feed.

## Filtering 

<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/Sorting%20and%20Filter%20Circled.jpg" width="200" height="400" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/Filter%20by%20Complete.PNG" width="200" height="400" />

On the DAHA screen, users can filter by complete and incomplete. Users can also sort by date (increasing vs decreasing), allowing them to see both old and new posts quickly. In order to mark things as complete, users can go the My Shop and My Requests screens in the profile tab. 

# DAWA 
## Feed
The DAWA feed renders as a two column scrollable grid of items being offered in the marketplace. The information displayed on the Shop Screen is the product title, the first image associated with the post, user who posted the offer, the price, and (if applicable) the rental timeframe. To find more information about an item, click on any part of the box that its picture sits in. 


<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/ShopScreen.PNG?raw=true" width="200" height="400" />

Doing so leads to the associated Item Screen which contains additional information about the item. At the top there is an image carousel that is horizontally scrollable. The rest of the screen contains information about the item: what it is, whose selling it, its description, and its price. At the bottom of the screen there is a comments button. Clicking on it navigates the user to the comments associated with an item.

## Making new post

To create a new post in the marketplace, press the button in the lower right corner of the screen. 

<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/ShopScreen.PNG?raw=true" width="200" height="400" />

Doing so triggers a page that has fillable fields. To make a post, fill in the mandatory product name and description fields. Clicking on any of the three plus sign icons triggers the camera roll, allowing for up to three pictures to be selected. After clicking the "Post" button, the product is added to the marketplace as well as the user's My Shop screen, which is accessible via the Profile tab.

## Comments

<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/item-screen-comment-button.PNG" width="200" height="400" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/comments-before.PNG" width="200" height="400" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/comments-typing.PNG" width="200" height="400" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/comments-after.PNG" width="200" height="400" />

On the item screen, users can click the "Comments" button to access comments on the product. A user can then use the “Add a comment…” box near the bottom of the screen to type their own comment. After submitting the comment with the upward-facing arrow button, the new comment appears on the comments list, with the user’s name.


# Favorites
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/FavoritesScreen.PNG" width="200" height="400" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/FavoritesSold.PNG" width="200" height="400" />

The Favorites screen contains all of the DAWA posts that the user wants to keep track of. Whether they are still debating if they want the item, are waiting for their comment to be addressed, want to maintain easy access to one of their own offers, or some other reason, this screen provides easy access to DAWA posts for the user's purchasing convenience. To favorite an item, the user simply has to tap the black-outlined heart on the item's card in the shop or on the item's page after tapping it, and upon doing so it will fill in red to indicate that it is now favorited. To unfavorite, just perform the same action on a red heart.
 
After favoriting an item, the user can then navigate to the Favorites Screen and see all of their favorited posts presented in the order that they favorited them, from most to least recent. If one of these posts becomes marked as sold, the Favorites Screen will reflect this to show the user that the item they were interested in is now sold. Upon unfavoriting an item, it will be immediately removed from the Favorites screen.


# Profile
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/ProfileScreenNoPhoto.PNG" width="200" height="400" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/ProfileScreenNoPhotoCircle.png" width="200" height="400" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/ProfileScreen.PNG" width="200" height="400" />

The Profile screen is the hub for all information related to the current user. It displays their name, associated email, and profile picture and it provides access to the requests and offers they have made via the "My Requests" and "My Offers" icons respectively. From here the user can also change their profile picture and sign out of their account.

Upon creating an account and navigating to the Profile screen, the user will be met with the photo on the left, with no user photo added. They can then click on the camera icon, which is circled in red in the second picture, which will bring up their photo library from which they can select and crop a photo of their liking. After finalizing their photo, the result is the picture on the right where the photo is displayed within the orange-bordered frame.

## My Shop
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/MyOffersScreen.PNG" width="200" height="400" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/MyOffersScreenCircle.png" width="200" height="400" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/MyOffersScreenSold.PNG" width="200" height="400" />

The My Shop screen allows the user to view all of the DAWA posts that they have made in the history of their account. It also provides them with the important feature of marking their items as sold. To do so, they can check the box which is now displayed beneath each item and is circled in red in the middle image, unlike in the DAWA and Favorites screens. Doing so provides a visual that they are now sold, makes it so that they no longer appear in the Shop upon refresh, and can let people who have favorited them know that they are marked as sold by viewing the item in their Favorites Screen.

## My Requests
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/MyRequestsScreen.PNG" width="200" height="400" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/MyRequestsScreenCircle.png" width="200" height="400" />
<img src="https://github.com/KrishnanNair19/DAHA/blob/main/Wiki_Images/MyRequestsScreenComplete.PNG" width="200" height="400" />

The My Requests screen allows the user to view all of the DAHA requests that they have made in the history of their account. From this screen, they can now check the circle on the left-hand side of the request, which is circled in red in the middle image, to mark it as completed which they weren't able to do from the Requests screen. This change will be reflected on the Requests screen upon refresh.
