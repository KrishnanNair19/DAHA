# Welcome to the DAHA?'s wiki

## What's the app?
DAHA? is an app built by Stanford students designed to shape the way that Stanford students buy, rent, and sell their belongings on campus. Inspired by DAHA ("Does anyone have a...") requests in dorm chats and the need for Stanford seniors to sell their belongings before graduation, our app allows users to make campus-wide DAHA requests to alert the community about in-demand items. With this community DAHA list, members can see which belongings can be sold quickly, and make corresponding DAWA ("Does anyone want a...") posts. By understanding the demand side of the market, we hope to reduce product wastage and promote reuse of belongings.

## Why do we need an online platform for this?
The primary marketplace for Stanford students is currently Facebook marketplace. However, it is easy to see that this market place tends to be relatively unorganized and excludes the market of students who do not use Facebook. Furthermore, Facebook marketplace, along with most other marketplaces, focus on the seller side of the exchange. Users can easily put their belongings up for sale, but there is no understanding of what people may be searching for. Our app is designed to balance the consumer and seller side of exchanges, using consumer needs to fuel sellers desire to sell belongings.
